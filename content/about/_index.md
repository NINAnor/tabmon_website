## 🌍 Project Overview

**TABMON — Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring Network.**  
TABMON establishes a **cross-country passive acoustic monitoring** network to complement existing biodiversity schemes and address gaps in reporting for EU directives and the **EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030**. The network spans from the Mediterranean to the Arctic and focuses on turning large-scale soundscape data into policy-relevant indicators.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- 📡 Deploy and operate a distributed network of autonomous **acoustic recorders** across **Norway, the Netherlands, France, and Spain**
- 🤖 Develop AI pipelines that convert audio into species/community metrics aligned with **Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs)**
- 🔗 Integrate outputs with national monitoring programmes to **fill reporting gaps** and support evidence-based decisions
- 📊 Create real-time biodiversity indicators for policy makers and conservation managers

## 💰 Funding & Context

🇪🇺 TABMON is supported under **Biodiversa+**, the European partnership for biodiversity under Horizon Europe, with national co-funding.

## 🔊 Why Acoustic Monitoring?

Acoustic sensing enables:
- 💡 **Cost-effective, scalable, and repeatable** biodiversity observations
- 🌙 Monitoring of nocturnal and cryptic taxa often missed by traditional surveys
- ⏰ High-frequency time series suitable for early-warning indicators
- 🌐 Continuous 24/7 monitoring across remote and inaccessible locations
- 🔄 Non-invasive data collection with minimal environmental impact

## 🗺️ Geographic Scope

Our network spans four key biogeographic regions:
- 🇳🇴 **Norway**: Arctic and boreal ecosystems
- 🇳🇱 **Netherlands**: Temperate lowland and coastal habitats  
- 🇫🇷 **France**: Mediterranean and temperate transition zones
- 🇪🇸 **Spain**: Mediterranean and montane ecosystems
