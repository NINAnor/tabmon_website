## ðŸ“Š Live Monitoring Dashboard

Welcome to TABMON's results portal â€” your gateway to real-time biodiversity insights from across Europe. Our network of acoustic sensors continuously captures the sounds of nature, transforming them into actionable conservation intelligence.

---

## Planned releases
- **Deployment dashboard** (public): summary of device metadata and coverage.  
- **Baseline indicators:** site- and region-level acoustic activity indices and preliminary species/community metrics (with uncertainty).  
- **Country syntheses:** integration with national monitoring schemes to identify **reporting gaps** and potential complements.

## Status
- Network devices procured and distributed; cloud ingestion and logistical transfer (cloud â†’ NIRD) are operational.  
- Indicator pipeline under active development (classification, embeddings, uncertainty).
