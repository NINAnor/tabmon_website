## 🌍 Building Europe's Acoustic Biodiversity Network

**TABMON** is establishing a **transnational acoustic monitoring network** to turn large-scale soundscape recordings into biodiversity indicators that matter for conservation policy and management. The project harmonises collection, analysis, and integration of acoustic data so results are comparable across countries and programmes.

### 🎯 Our Mission

Deploy **autonomous acoustic sensors** across a wide latitudinal gradient in Europe and use **AI** to transform soundscapes into decision-ready indicators. The aim is to **complement existing monitoring** and help fill gaps in reporting to **EU directives** while supporting the **EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030** targets.

## 🚀 Key Features

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

**🔬 AI-Powered Analysis**  
From raw audio to species detections, community metrics, and EBV-aligned indicators, with an emphasis on reproducible workflows.

**🌐 Multi-country Coverage**  
Initial deployments span **Norway, the Netherlands, France, and Spain**, representing diverse European habitats.

**📊 Open Methods**  
Transparent protocols and open-source code **where licences and sensitivities allow**, following FAIR principles.

**⚡ Near Real-Time Capabilities**  
Selected sites use low-power devices that support near real-time acoustic streaming/processing to track change more quickly.

## 🎵 The Sound of Biodiversity

*"Every forest, grassland, and wetland has a distinct acoustic signature. By listening at scale and over time, we can quantify change and support better conservation decisions."*
