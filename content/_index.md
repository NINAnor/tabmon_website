## 🌍 Building Europe's Acoustic Biodiversity Network

**TABMON** is establishing a **transnational acoustic monitoring network** to turn large-scale soundscape recordings into biodiversity indicators that matter for conservation policy and management. The project harmonises collection, analysis, and integration of acoustic data so results are comparable across countries and programmes.

### 🎯 Our Mission

Deploy **autonomous acoustic sensors** across a wide latitudinal gradient in Europe and use **AI** to transform soundscapes into decision-ready indicators. The aim is to **complement existing monitoring** and help fill gaps in reporting to **EU directives** while supporting the **EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030** targets.
