## Another year into TABMON

We are now two years into the TABMON project. While we had encountered quite a lot of difficulties in 2024 with the device deployment, we finally got to collect **A LOT** of data in 2025 and currently have **over 20TB of data** of raw acoustic soundscape. We analyzed most of the TABMON 2025 data and we can visualise some bird vocalisation patterns as well as the species we have detected across our network.

## 2025 TABMON reports available on Zenodo

The results from our preliminary analysis are completely open source and are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17899019)!
