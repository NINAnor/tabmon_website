## Another year into TABMON

We are now two years into the TABMON project. While we had encountered quite a lot of difficulties in 2024 with the device deployment, we finally got to collect **A LOT** of data in 2025 and currently have **over 20TB of data** of raw acoustic soundscape. We analyzed most of the TABMON 2025 data and we can visualise some bird vocalisation patterns as well as the species we have detected across our network.

## 2025 TABMON reports available on Zenodo

The results from our preliminary analysis are completely open source and are available on **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17899019)**!

The reports have been generated for each clusters of devices and contains informations related to the recorders uptime, the species that have been detected along with their vulnerability status and some other visualisation of the data such as the number of vocalisations detected per hour of the day per species.

## TABMON in 2026

2026 will be the last year of the TABMON project and we will continue to collect data across our network of devices. We will also work on improving our data processing pipeline and our AI models so that we are able to detect species with a higher accuracy. 

Because, AI models' performance varies across conditions (e.g. environmental conditions, various soundscapes), we are also working on evaluating when and where can we trust BirdNET results. In particular we are evaluating how model confidence and uncertainty varies across space and time.
