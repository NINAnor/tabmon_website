We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the **TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring Network)** project! 

## A New Era for Biodiversity Monitoring

TABMON represents a groundbreaking initiative that will establish Europe's largest acoustic biodiversity monitoring network. Over the next three years (2024-2027), our consortium will deploy cutting-edge autonomous acoustic sensors across diverse European landscapes.

## Project Highlights

- **100 monitoring devices** to be deployed across Norway, Netherlands, France, and Spain
- **AI-powered analysis** for species detection and biodiversity assessment
- **Transnational collaboration** with leading research institutions
- **Open science approach** ensuring data accessibility and reproducibility

## What's Next?

Our team is already working on the first phase of device deployment, with initial sites selected across our partner countries. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and early findings from the field!

## Funding and Partners

TABMON is funded through **Biodiversa+** with support from national agencies. Our consortium includes the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), University of Amsterdam, Naturalis, University of Toulon and Catalonian Institute for Forest Research (CTFC).
