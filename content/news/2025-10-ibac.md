[Ben McEwen](/team/) , a postdoctoral researcher at Tilburg University, presented a poster at the **International Bioacoustic Congress (IBAC)** in Kerteminde, Denmark, discussing TABMON with the wider bioacoustics community.

The poster, **Active Sampling for Data Efficient Large-Scale Bioacoustic Monitoring**, showcased the consortiumâ€™s work towards tackling the central challenges in transnational bioacoustic monitoring such as data scale, spatial and temporal variability, and reliable detection of underrepresented species.

This work explores **how active learning can improve training efficiency and enhance model performance**. The team has built a data pipeline capable of processing continuous recordings from microphones deployed across Europe, spanning from Norway to Spain. Together, these tools aim to make transnational biodiversity monitoring both more scalable and effective. The data pipeline is open-source and available on GitHub.
